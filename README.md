This is some information on the background of this project and my experience of creating it so far.

This project started when I wanted to build something with the skills that I had learnt using Python. This was a project that included most of the skills that I had learnt including:

- Functions 
- Variables 
- For loops 
- Modules 

I also wanted this to be a project that gave me a new tool and would automate and enhance an important task.

The main premise of the program is that it generates a password based upon the chosen preferences of the user. The user is given the choice of the amount of characters used, whether there are upper case letters or not, if there are numbers or not and if there are special characters or not.

Afterwards, the program will generate a string based upon these choices and ask the user if they are happy with it. If they reply 'no' then they are taken to the beginning of the program. If they reply 'yes', then the use is asked to name the password with a small acronym. The password is then stored in a notepad file on a new line in that file. The password is then copied to the clipboard so that it can be pasted into an online form if needed.

I would say that this was the first thing I created of use using my newly aqcuired skills in Python. It may not be exciting or original as a project idea, but I remain very proud of it.
